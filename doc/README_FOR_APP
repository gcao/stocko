_____________________________________________

! StockPrice, MarketData, Array(of stock price or market data) custom methods
up? <=> close > open
down? <=> close < open
change <=> (close - open)/open
max_change <=> (high - low)/open
next(days = 1) <=> StockPrice of next 1 or N days
prev(days = 1) <=> StockPrice of prev 1 or N days

! Array(of stock price or market data) custom methods
volume(average), high, low, open, close, start_date, end_date 
stock_array?
stock_price_array?
market_data_array?

! Add stock names as class methods to Stock, e.g. Stock.ibm

! Alias S to Stock, M to Market # may be a bad idea. the API should be as readable as possible, e.g. Stock.ibm is better than S.ibm

Delegate volume, open, close, high, low etc to stock.prices or market.data

stock.change_between(from, to, days=1)
stock.change_less_than(value, days=1) # absolute change is less than value
stock.change_greater_than(value, days=1) # absolute change is greater than value
array of (array of consecutive stock prices)

Check how irb and script/console is implemented, we probably can plug in a context object?!
